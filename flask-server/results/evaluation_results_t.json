            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] (01:02:14.72) I think in this module we will cover this and cryptography, maybe in the 3000 or 4000 module when they cover network security, they may cover a bit.\n(01:02:32.64) Another typical problem I have mentioned is that when you do searching, you will soon realize that you need to sort your data.\n(01:02:42.68) If you do not sort your data, your searching will take a long time to find the key.\n(01:02:52.40) So sorting is another typical problem in computer science that we will discuss in 2101.\n(01:03:01.40) For example, I want to find the top 5%.\n(01:03:06.24) I want to find the median of the given data.\n(01:03:10.64) If you do not sort the data, like in this example, you will find that you need to take some time to find the median, right?\n(01:03:22.40) Basically, you'll find that first you need to sort the data.\n(01:03:24.64) First, I need to sort this to 171520, then 1920, then 3253, and then 77.\n(01:03:46.20) After you sort the data, you can almost instantly find the median.\n(01:03:57.96) So that will be covered in the next level here.\n(01:04:01.92) Just to let you know, sorting is another topic.\n(01:04:06.28) In sorting, we will also discuss stability.\n(01:04:12.44) Stability refers to when you need to sort multiple columns.\n(01:04:22.56) For example, you want to sort the age of the students and then sort the GPA.\n(01:04:39.84) When you sort the age, many students may have the same age.\n(01:04:45.56) Then, when you start sorting the GPA, you may lose the sequence of the ages.\n(01:04:53.32) That is what stability means.\n(01:04:57.92) With a stable sorting algorithm, you will sort the repeated elements in the same order that they appear in the input.\n(01:05:08.88) This will be discussed when we talk about sorting algorithms in 2101.\n(01:05:18.96) Here, I'm not going into too much detail about this.\n(01:05:22.32) Another topic we will cover in the next level is string processing.\n(01:05:26.32) After you know how to do searching, we can move on.",

            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] (01:19:15.11) For algorithms, I think the common one is \"Introduction to Algorithms.\"\n(01:19:23.44) Yes.\n(01:19:23.96) This book can be used not only at this level but also in other courses.\n(01:19:31.76) That's a good design.\n(01:19:32.80) Yes.\n(01:19:33.96) Another book is \"Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms.\"\n(01:19:44.84) Yes, this is another one.\n(01:19:46.20) I think it's not bad, but you will find that these books do not teach you how to implement the algorithms.\n(01:19:54.84) They focus more on pseudocode and algorithm analysis.\n(01:20:06.20) I don't know why the school arranged all the tutorial sessions online.\n(01:20:13.24) I think it's mainly due to class sizes; they couldn't find an appropriate place for the tutorial sessions.\n(01:20:24.36) So the tutorial classes will be online.\n(01:20:29.68) In this module, we only have six tutorials; it's not every week.\n(01:20:41.24) Just take notes.\n(01:20:42.20) The lab schedule is almost every week, but tutorials are not.\n(01:20:52.84) I arranged it this way so that if you have any problems after the lab, you still have a tutor available to clarify your doubts.\n(01:21:02.48) If that's still not enough, then you probably have to seek additional help.\n(01:21:17.84) Yes.\n(01:21:18.24) I suggest that whenever you have any doubts after the lab session or tutorial, you should clarify them as soon as possible.\n(01:21:28.80) Don't wait until the last minute.\n(01:21:31.64) This module is not something you can learn at the last minute. Programming and coding require a lot of practice, and the lab test will not consist of questions directly from the lab or assignments.\n(01:21:58.76) This module does not require you to memorize code for the test.\n(01:22:11.20) You need to be able to solve real-world problems.\n(01:22:16.08) We expect you to analyze the problem, understand it, come up with your own algorithm, select appropriate data structures, and then implement them.

The lab test 1 will be held on 3rd March, Thursday, and lab test 2 and the quiz will be conducted on 21st April.\n(19:09.08) Please take note of these two dates; they are very important. The details about the venue and the time slots for the tests will be released properly in week 3 or week 4 after the drop period ends."
