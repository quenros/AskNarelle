            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] And I think in this module we just cover this one and cryptography maybe in the 3000 or 4000 module when they cover about the those network security, they may cover a bit.\nAnother typical problem we you just I have mentioned like when you do the searching you very soon you'll realize that you need to sort your data.\nIf you not sort your data, your searching will take long times to yeah, will take longer time to find out the the the key.\nSo sorting is another typical problem in computer science we will discuss in 2101.\nYeah, the application for example, I want to find the top 5%.\nI want to find the medium of the given data.\nYeah, if you not sorted the data like this example, you will find that you need to take some time to find out the the medium, right?\nYeah, basically you'll find that first you need to sort the data.\nFirst I need to sort this thing to 171520, then 19, sorry, 1920, then 3253 and then 77.\nAfter you sort the data, the medium, you almost can instantly find out.\nBut if you're not sorting sort the data, you will take a lot of time to find the medium.\nSo that will cover in the next level here.\nJust let you know.\nSorting is another one.\nYeah.\nAnd in the sorting we also discussed about the stability.\nStability is like when you have some date actually when you have you need to sort multiple, multiple column, Yeah.\nLike you want to sort the edge of the student.\nYou want to sort the, the edge, the, the, the, the, the G maybe GPA, Yeah.\nSo when you sort the edge, then of course a lot of student have the same edge.\nThen when you start sorting the GPA you reach that you will miss out the edge, the sequence of the edge.\nSo in that, that is the stability, stability.\nThe next you have a stable sorting algorithm, you will sort the repeated, repeated element in the same order that they appear in the input.\nYeah.\nSo this thing will be something we discussed when we talked about the sorting algorithm in 2101.\nSo here I'm not going into two details about this.\nAnother one we'll cover in the next level is the string processing.\nAfter you know how to do the searching, then we can.",
            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] I have the yeah, I, I for algorithm wise, I think this is the comment one is 1.\nYeah.\nBut this one can be used not only in this level, also the two one O 1 other ones.\nThat's a design.\nYeah.\nWhich what is the Yeah.\nAnother book.\nAnother book.\nWhat is the name?\nYeah.\nIntroduction to the design and analysis of algorithm.\nYeah, this is another one.\nI think it's not bad, but all this book you will find that they they are not teaching you how to implement the algorithm.\nThey're more focused on the the pseudocode and analysis of algorithm tutorial is.\nI don't know why the school arranged all the tutorial section and as online.\nI think mainly online.\nProbably due to the class sites, yeah, they wouldn't be able to find appropriate place for the tutorial section.\nSo the tutorial class will be online.\nBut this module have to take notes on this module, we only have 6 tutorial, it's not every week is yeah.\nSo just take notes.\nThe schedule lab is almost every week, but tutorial is not.\nI put in this order so that if you have any problem after the lab, you still have a tutor there.\nYou can clarify your doubt, but if still not enough then you probably have to.\nYou can drop me an e-mail or arrange some consultation.\nYeah.\nTo clarify your doubt.\nI suggest is like whenever you have any doubt in the in after the lab section or tutorial, you should clarify as soon as possible.\nDon't wait until last minute.\nSo because this module, yeah, if it's not something you can learn in in, in, in in the last minute, actually the programming, the coding, you will take a lot of time to to practice and the lab test is not something you you expect that the lab test.\nThe question is not something from the lab or assignment.\nSo this module is not ask you to memorize the code for the test.\nYeah, you need to be able to solve the real world problem.\nI think we aspect is are you able to we give you a problem, you need to analyze the problem and understand the problem and then you come out your own algorithm, select appropriate data structure and then you implement them other than ask you to go.",
            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] So in this lecture, so I need to highlight it's like algorithm is not just simply a computer program implementation.\nIt involve the algorithm analysis and also the not only the implementation but also the analysis of algorithm.\nAnd then in this module, you will learn mainly the searching and the graph problem and sorting and string matching and other geometric problem and the optimization problem will cover in the future.\nIn the higher level, this module will focus on searching and graph problem and graph traversal problem and then lecture you.\nYeah, we will just cover.\nI try not to cover too much about the implementation.\nImplementation will let you practice in the lab.\nSo although the lab is not graded, but I strongly encourage you to attend all the lab section.\nYeah, it's quite important.\nYou don't expect you can practice the audience coding overnight before the test?\nYou have to.\nEvery week you have to go to the lab and practice your coding and do the assignment before.\nYeah, it's not possible learn all these things in the last minute, OK.\nTutorial wise will be, Yeah, focus on the concept, understanding and discussion and give you have a chance to clarify your doubt.\nYeah.\nAnd then lab section is mainly focused on practice.\nYeah.\nAnd also the assignment, OK.\nSo on I think Friday I will cover the linked list and the pointer and all all the dynamic.\nI think first I will cover the pointer and then the dynamic data structure.\nAnd if time allowed, I will cover a bit linked list on Friday lecture.\nYeah, should be fine.\nYeah, Friday, 10:30 to 11:30.\nOK, that is today's lecture, any question.\nSo practice only can be done in the lab.\nAnd also I, I strongly encourage you to, to install the, the cop block first.\nYeah, in week 1.\nAnd yeah, you, you can practice at home.\nThe, the, the lab is not compulsory because it's not created, but you are strongly encouraged to attend the lab session because that is the only chance you can practice and there are some teaching assistant there to to help you.\nOK, any question, if you have any question, you can drop the e-mail to me.\nYeah, this is my e-mail address.\nDo you have any recommendation book?\nOK, I I think it's in the notes.",

The speaker provides an example where sorting the data is necessary to quickly find the median. They emphasize that sorting is a typical problem in computer science and will be covered in more detail in a future module (2101). The concept of stability in sorting is also introduced, explaining that stable sorting algorithms maintain the order of repeated elements.
