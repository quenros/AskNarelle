            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] And and that is involved a lot of, again, you'll find that in computer science actually involve a lot of problem, actually involve a Yeah, a lot in mathematics first, before you can really implement the program.\nYou want to appreciate this one, you want to solve this problem.\nYeah, your Max must be good, especially in geometric before you can implement it.\nYeah.\nThis we will not cover in this module, just let you know just for your information, another one is a very typical problem in engineering.\nYeah, that is the numerical problem or and the optimization problem, because in engineering a lot of time we will not be able to get the best answer.\nWe only be able to get the optimum answer in engineering and that is in.\nYeah, is another series of the computing problem.\nYeah.\nThen you use the numerical approximation.\n1 is like linear programming is one of them, yeah, which is trying to find the optimum is a is one of the optimization technique.\nLike I want to find, I want to find the the minimum of 3X plus YYI have some constraint and five X + 3 Y must be greater than 29.\nAnd and that is if you convert it to the daily life problem.\nIt is like in economy, in engineering a lot of time we want to make a decision.\nWe have a few factor maybe for example in in economy we have the the worker X can be my, my, my staff salary and then Y can be my resource.\nThe the cost of the all the resource.\nThen of course I have some constraint.\nYeah, I cannot hire too many people, I cannot have too unlimited resource.\nSo all these constraint, given all these constraint, what is the optimum revenue I can have?\nYeah, So that is the typical optimization problem we have in our daily life.\nAnd then yeah, it can be solved by linear programming.\nYeah, that is the optimization problem that involve a lot of mathematics and before you can implement realized it in a program.\nThis thing again we will not cover in this module.\nI'm just trying to let you know these are all the possible programming problem.\nSo all this problem, yeah, how do we solve this problem?\nOf course, we, you, you involve a lot of data, then you need to be able to well represent the data in the appropriate data structure, then that can help you to solve the problem.",
            "[Video title] Introduction to Data Structure and Algorithm\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] Another one interesting 1 is this combinatorial problem, which is very common in our daily life.\nA lot of time we want to solve certain problem, we need to consider all the possible case, all the, all the possible combination, all the possible permutation.\nAnd before we can make the decision.\nAnd that sort of a problem.\nYeah, it's a combinatorial problem.\nWe will cover a little bit in the last two weeks in the end of this module.\nYeah, it can be applied in the cryptography.\nYeah.\nWhen you have you, when you want to send some message, you want to encrypt it, you want to encode it and decode it.\nAnd this encoder and decoder algorithm, yeah, involve the cryptography.\nYeah, you need to make sure that you encode the message in the other end, decode it, you're going to get back the same message.\nAnd that involve that you need to consider all the permutation and combination of your message and make sure your encoder always give you and decoder always give you the right result.\nSo that is one typical combinatorial problem.\nAnother one we will cover in this module is the matching problem.\nYou have a few Walker here and you have different job, different Walker have different capability to do different job and how do you assign the job to the Walker?\nThat is the very typical matching problem, yeah.\nAnd then another one very typical is yeah, we have to find the is another is a graph problem.\nAnother graph problem is the cover problem.\nBut yeah, covering problem, you want covering problem means that you want to find 2 the the minimum number of vertex, the minimum number of vertex which did those those vertex are connected to the rest of the nodes, the vertex in the graph in this example.\nOK, yeah, these two, this one and this one, basically you cover you connected to all the nodes in the graph.\nThis is another kind of yeah.\nBut how do you find the minimum number of vertex cover the whole graph?\nThat is another combinatorial problem.\nYeah, there are so many combination.\nAnd how do you know these two give you the minimum number of vertex cover the whole graph?\nYeah, this is the typical combinatorial problem and a lot more.\nYeah, here I just show you a few example.",

        "answer": "Some algorithm design strategies mentioned in the video include:\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**: This strategy involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: This approach is used for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions to smaller subproblems. It typically involves storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Greedy Algorithms**: This strategy makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope that these local optimum choices will lead to a global optimum solution.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: This method involves exploring all possible solutions and abandoning those that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem.\n\nThese strategies are essential for effectively designing algorithms to solve various types of computational problems.",
