The problem types we will cover in this module include searching, and another one we will focus on in the second half is a few graph problems.\n(53:20.68) Yes, graph problems are a big topic, but we will only introduce graph representation, breadth-first search, depth-first search, and some classical graph problems like backtracking techniques.\n(53:39.04) We will also introduce another matching problem.\n(53:43.84) Yes, so that also involves combinatorial problems.\n(53:49.36) Then in 2101, at the next level, we will cover sorting and string processing.\n(53:55.84) There are other problems like geometric problems and numerical problems.\n(54:00.20) Yes, actually, they are quite typical problems in computer science.\n(54:04.44) These few are very typical problems, like searching.\n(54:11.36) It's very classic.

        "answer": "Some algorithm design strategies include:\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**: This strategy involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: This approach is used for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions to smaller subproblems. It typically involves storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Greedy Algorithms**: This strategy makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is often used in optimization problems where a series of choices leads to the best overall solution.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: This is a method for solving problems incrementally, building candidates for solutions and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that it cannot lead to a valid solution.\n\n5. **Brute Force**: This straightforward approach involves trying all possible solutions to find the best one. While it is often not efficient, it can be useful for small problem sizes or as a baseline for comparison with more sophisticated methods.\n\nThese strategies are fundamental in algorithm design and can be applied to various problem types in computing.",
